# Shopping Cart with Product listing page
Repository contains small practice project, based upon a very small workflow i.e shopping cart with the product listing page.
Idea behind was to get hands-on (in 2017) on React and use Redux as a state managment library..

In order to have local environment also did some manual basic webpack steup having plugin like:
 - offcourse react, react-dom, redux react-redux
 - sass-loader
 - babel-loader
 - for reducers (https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers)
 - for routing (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
 - webpack-dev-server etc.

#### How to setup on my localbox ####
